# 🔒 Persistent Email Storage Setup

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Email Data Persistence

Your Resumly waitlist now uses **persistent storage** to ensure subscriber emails are **NEVER DELETED** during deployments or updates.

## 🏗️ Storage Technology

- **Database**: Vercel KV (Redis-based)
- **Persistence**: 100% guaranteed across all deployments
- **Backup**: Automatic Redis persistence
- **Recovery**: Built-in failover and logging

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable Vercel KV Database

1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your `resumly-landing-page` project
3. Navigate to the **Storage** tab
4. Click **Create Database**
5. Select **KV (Redis)**
6. Name it: `resumly-emails`
7. Click **Create & Connect**

### 2. Automatic Configuration

Vercel will automatically set these environment variables:
- `KV_URL`
- `KV_REST_API_URL`
- `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
- `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`

**No manual configuration needed!**

### 3. Deploy with Persistence

After KV setup, deploy again:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## ✅ Features Enabled

### 🛡️ Data Protection
- **Never Lose Emails**: Persistent across all deployments
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatic email deduplication
- **Backup Logging**: Console logs for manual recovery
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks

### 📊 Admin Dashboard
- **Real Subscriber Count**: Always accurate
- **Historical Data**: Complete signup history
- **Security Logging**: Admin access tracking

### 🔍 Monitoring
- Console logs show: `📊 Total emails (PERSISTENT): X`
- Admin dashboard loads from Redis storage
- All timestamps preserved permanently

## 🚨 Before KV Setup

Until you set up Vercel KV, the system will:
- ❌ Show connection errors in logs
- ❌ Not persist emails across deployments
- ✅ Still function but data will be temporary

## 🎯 After KV Setup

Once Vercel KV is connected:
- ✅ All emails stored permanently in Redis
- ✅ Admin dashboard shows accurate counts
- ✅ Zero data loss during deployments
- ✅ Production-ready email collection

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you see errors like "kv is not defined":
1. Ensure KV database is created in Vercel
2. Redeploy the project after KV setup
3. Check Vercel environment variables are set
